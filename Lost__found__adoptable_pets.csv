You can also find me by my ID #A517133. I am a 2 year old rabbit with a  soft, gray speckled coat! My breed is called a Chinchilla rabbit.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by a field services officer in the middle of December 2016. During my stay I have been very mellow and enjoy being pet! <p></p><p></p>I like to be snuggled when I'm in the mood but a lot of the time I just like to hop around and eat my hay. I was brought in with several other rabbits so I may be open to a rabbit friend.<p></p><p></p>I can't wait to find my new forever home that will give me the care I need and the space to hop around and lounge. I also would prefer to be housed inside in my next home where I can feel safe and comfortable. My diet consists of Timothy Hay, pellets and fresh greens and my hay should be available to me at all times. I am already fixed and my adoption comes with a free vet exam!<p></p><p></p>Come meet me today at the King County Pet Adoption Center, or call (206) 296-3936 to learn more about me!<p></p>Adoption Fee: $30<p></p>"

I am a little over a year old. I came to the shelter as a stray with a broken leg. So I have had time in a foster home to heal up before I am adopted. After my leg healed I have been just fine, without any deformity or problems related to it. The good part is that since I have been in foster care they know a lot about me, my personality and habits.  It makes it much less of an unknown for anyone who wants to adopt me.<p></p>So here's what my foster mom says about me: &quot;Samara is a somewhat timid girl at times and walks or runs away when  approached with the following exceptions,1) is when I'm in the kitchen - she's a good eater and always up for food, even rubs against my legs and lets me pet her. 2)The other instance is if she's lying on a chair or couch or on the cat tree. I can walk up to her and pet her and she purrs up a storm. She will even lie on my lap. She gets along with my two senior boy cats.  She has not been around dogs at my house. She's very good with the litter box.&quot; <p></p>So that is what my foster mom says. Now, since I am a bit on the timid side at times(all of us cats have our own unique personalities) it would be best to be in a quiet household where if children are present they will be respectful of my need to have my own personal space.  I will need time to adjust to a new family. I have my vaccinations,am microchipped and am healthy...now all I need is my own family. Please ask to see me, you will get yourself one wonderful cat!<p></p>Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set. Please inquire with the shelter.<p></p>"

My previous owner described me as shy. And they believe that I don't like being around men but I love women. I do love playing with strings but I mostly love playing hide and seek and taking long cat naps. I have met some cats at the shelter and I like them as long as we have a safe distance between us. I will occassionally hiss at them but it's only because I am a little bit scared. I love to play hide and seek and take long cat naps! My old owner also told the shelter staff that I'm scared with loud noises, so a calm home where I can lounge and snuggle would be the best option for me!<p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

You can also find me by my ID #A520219.<p></p><p></p>I was originally brought in with my mother Momma #A520217 to a shelter in Eastern Washington in November 2016 after our previous owner passed away. I was then transferred with my mother to RASKC on February 8, 2017.<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I need some time to come out of my shell. Once I start seeing you petting my mother, I come on over for some pets of my own and love to rub the top of my head against your hand. I can be nervous about forms of restraint, so I would appreciate a gentle family that can give me space when I need it. <p></p><p></p>I am looking for a family that will allow me the time and love to become comfortable and come out of my shell. I will need regular grooming and brushing so that my long fur does not become matted. I would do best in a home with respectful children that will be gentle with me and understand that I am not super comfortable being carried around.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE.  I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow.  I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.  Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p></p><p></p>If your home is big enough for two very fluffy cats, my mother and I would love to be adopted together! We love to lie together and groom one another. If adopted separately, we may do well with a feline friend in our new home to bond to.<p></p><p></p>I'd love to meet you!

You can also find me by my ID #A516964. I'm only 12 years old! While some may be dissauded by my age, I feel it has only given me more time to become the most perfect cat!<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner in the middle of December 2016 because they were moving and could not take me along. Staff and volunteers at the shelter have fallen in love with me. I love to spend time with my people and it is hard to miss my loud purr! I can be a little shy at first but warm up quickly! Some tortoiseshell cats can have some &quot;tortitude&quot; - cat attitude. While I am a very sweet girl, I can get overstimulated sometimes, so please keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break!<p></p><p></p>I have been around other cats while at the shelter, but at my age I would prefer to be the only pet in my new home. My caregivers are recommending a calm household for me with respectful children due to my age and quiet demeanor.<p></p><p></p>I'd love to meet you! Come meet me today at the Kent Pet Adoption Center, or call (206) 296-3936 to learn more about me!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

My name is Otis and I am available for adoption at the Eastside Pet Adoption Center inside the Kirkland Petco. I am about one and a half years old and have a cute, scruffy gray terrier coat. You can also find me by my ID #A470418.<p></p><p></p>I was brought into the shelter by my previous adopter on February 14, 2017 because I was not the best fit for their household. I need a dog savvy and experience owner that understands how scary the world can be for a little guy like me and can slowly gain my trust. I would also do best in an adult only home and with another social dog or multiple dogs in my home that will show me the ropes and who I can follow around and mimic.<p></p><p></p>I am very easily spooked and frightened in new situations and with new people. I love treats though and I am slowly improving as shelter staff and volunteers work with me. I will need a family who is willing to go at my pace and be very patient. On the other end, I need an owner that will encourage me to push my boundaries and safely become more confident.<p></p><p></p>It will still take me time to continue to gain more confidence, but I seem to enjoy being around people and I have lots of potential! I am a very sweet boy when I warm up to you and I love playing when comfortable! <p></p><p></p>I still need a lot of work getting used to walking on leash. I still sometimes dart away from people, so I should not be allowed to roam a yard off-leash but access to a fully secure, fenced yard will help me become more and more comfortable on leash at my own pace.<p></p><p></p>Once I am comfortable in the home, I have displayed some separation anxiety related behaviors. I am looking for a family familiar with working with a dog with separation anxiety. Having another dog in the home may also help reduce my anxiety when my people are not around.<p></p><p></p>If you would like more information about me, please call (425) 406-8081 or come to the Eastside Pet Adoption Center inside the Kirkland Petco to meet me!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p></p>"
